# 👩‍💻 Aspiring Data Scientist | BCA Final Year Student

Hi there! I'm currently in my third year of Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) and on a journey to become a Data Scientist. My passion lies in learning, exploring, and applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems.

## 💡 What Drives Me
- 🚀 Curiosity for data: I love discovering insights and building intelligent solutions from raw data.
- 💻 Hands-on learning: I believe in the power of practical projects to truly understand concepts.
- 🧠 Competitive growth: I'm actively participating in HackerRank competitions to sharpen my skills and benchmark my progress.

## 🔧 Skills I'm Building
- Python for data analysis and modeling  
- SQL and relational databases  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning  
- Power BI and Tableau for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## 📁 Current Projects
- 📊 **Personal Finance Dashboard** – Using synthetic data in Power BI to analyze spending patterns  
- 🧠 **ML Mini Projects** – Classification and regression models applied to real datasets  
- 🛠️ **Portfolio Website** – Designed using low-effort tools like Wix and Framer  

## 🎯 Short-Term Goals
- Build a professional portfolio with a custom domain and logo  
- Launch and showcase at least 3 data-driven projects  
- Reach intermediate level in HackerRank and complete Python track  
- Collaborate with peers on open-source or group projects
