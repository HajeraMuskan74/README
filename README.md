# 👩‍💻 Aspiring Data Scientist | BCA Final Year Student

Hi there! I'm currently in my final year of Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) and on a journey to become a Data Scientist. My passion lies in learning, exploring, and applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems.

## 💡 What Drives Me
- 🚀 Curiosity for data: I love discovering insights and building intelligent solutions from raw data.
- 💻 Hands-on learning: I believe in the power of practical projects to truly understand concepts.
- 🧠 Competitive growth: I'm actively participating in HackerRank competitions to sharpen my skills and benchmark my progress.

## 🔧 Skills I'm Building
- Python for data analysis and modeling  
- SQL and relational databases  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn for Machine learning  
- Power BI and Tableau for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation  
- Git & GitHub for version control  

## 📁 Current Projects
- 📊 **Customer Segmentation** –  To generate insights from raw data in order to grow business by using only SQL Technology.
- 🧠 **Real Estate Price Predictor** – Regression model helps to predict house price by using real dataset.
- 🛠️ **End-to-End Machine learning model for a Entertainment platform** – Designed model to classify Customers to tackle Problems and built real world solutions to grow bussiness.

## 🎯 Short-Term Goals
- Build a professional portfolio with a custom domain and logo  
- Launch and showcase at least 3 data-driven projects
